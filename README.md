# Hash Code 2017 Warmup

This is our entry for the warm up round of Google Hash Code 2017 which is located in the directory `pizza`. We also solved many other problems from past contests that are contained in the respective directories.

You can find more information about the contest at https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/.

# Technical Data

Almost all code is written in C++. You can run the code by simply starting `make all`. Output data can be generated using `make data` while visualizations can be generated by `make visualizations`. More commands can be found in the `Makefile` of each directory.

Most code is written during the 4 hours of the contest and therefore not optimized.
